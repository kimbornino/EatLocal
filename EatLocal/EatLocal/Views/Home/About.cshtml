<h3>Good for the Environment</h3>
<p>
    Many of us have taken the time to think about how our eating habits impact the environment.  Another way to reduce carbon footprints is to purchase foods that do not have to be shipped long distances, which reduces our carbon footprints.
    <h3>Good for Our Community</h3>
<p>This way of eating helps to support farmers and small business in this community. </p>
<p>
    Farmers markets foster interactions among people of different race, class, age, and lifestyle. 28% of respondents surveyed about public markets said the greatest benefit of the market to the community is that it “Brings people together.”  <br /><br /> - Farmer\n's Market Coalition

<h3>Good for Me. And hopefully you too!</h3>

<p>As a person aspiring to be healthier, I need to have all of the tools for eating healthy in once place.  Although there are sites for finding markets, or sharing recipes, there was not one that put all the information I needed to plan out my meals and shopping.  Hopefully that's good for others as well.</p>
